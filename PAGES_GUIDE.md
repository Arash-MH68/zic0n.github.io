# Multi-Page Website Structure

The website has been converted from a single-page to a multi-page structure.

## Pages Created:
1. **index.html** - Home page (Hero section)
2. **about.html** - About Zic0n page
3. **services.html** - Services page
4. **markets.html** - Markets we serve
5. **capabilities.html** - Technical capabilities
6. **projects.html** - Project highlights
7. **approach.html** - Our approach
8. **leadership.html** - Leadership team
9. **advisory.html** - Advisory panel
10. **faqs.html** - Frequently asked questions
11. **contact.html** - Contact page

## Navigation:
All pages include a common header with navigation links to all other pages. The navigation works on both desktop and mobile.

## How to create remaining pages:
Each page should follow this structure:
1. Head section (meta tags, styles) - unique title per page
2. Header/Nav (same on all pages)
3. Main content (unique per page)
4. Footer (same on all pages)
5. JavaScript (same on all pages)

Pages can be created by copying the structure and replacing the main content section.
